# Capstone-Project-II
# Simple Game
# Project Information
# Description

This Simple Fame programme is witten in Python language. This Simple Game was created using Pygame. Pygame is a library of code that allows one to create simple games using Python. The purpose of this project was to adapt to working with code libraries. This Simple Game has  One ‘player’ object, Three ‘enemy’ objects and One ‘prize’ object.

# Features (How it works)

A black screen shows based on the dimensions specified in the code when the programme run. The player object shows at the top left-hand corner of the screen. The user playing the game can move the player around the screen using (up, down, left and right) keys on the keyboard. The three enemies move around the screen from different angles. The user playing the game must move the player object to avoid collision with the enemy object. If the player object collide's with the enemy object(they lose and the game ends). If the player object collide's with the prize object(they win the game and the game ends). If the player doesn't collide with the enemies but fails to collide with the prize(they lose the game and the game end). An appropriate message 'You win!' or 'You lose' message is displayed when the game ends.

# How to use this Simple Game

* In order to run this Simple Game program, you must install the Python interpreter program, and Pygame onto your computer's operating system
* Link to download the appropriate Python version for your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Link as a guide to using Python's Installer Program (PIP) to install Pygame, https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
* Once Python and Pygame are installed, you can run the code using IDLE programme file(automatically downloads with the Python program files). IDLE is an Integrated Development   Environment that allows you to read and execute codes.
* Once IDLE is opened it will display a "Shell" window, from the window, click "File", then click "Open" from the Toolbar(top of the Window) to open the Simple Game and navigate   to the pygame program to open it. The program will open in another window, separate to the Python shell.
* Before running the programme, make sure that the Pygame program and all the images (ee.g player, enemies, and the prize) are in the same folder because the programme will not   run if they are in different folders.
* To run the Simple Game, click "Run" on the Toolbar on top. The screen will then appear and you can move the player to start playing
* Enjoy! Make sure you win the prize and beat the enemies
